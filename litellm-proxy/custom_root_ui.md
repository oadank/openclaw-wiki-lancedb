# UI - Custom Root Path 


# UI - Custom Root Path 

💥 Use this when you want to serve LiteLLM on a custom base url path like `https://localhost:4000/api/v1` 

#### ℹ️ Info

Requires v1.72.3 or higher.



Limitations:
- This does not work in [litellm non-root](./deploy#non-root---without-internet-connection) images, as it requires write access to the UI files.

## Usage

### 1. Set `SERVER_ROOT_PATH` in your .env

👉 Set `SERVER_ROOT_PATH` in your .env and this will be set as your server root path

```
```

### 2. Run the Proxy

```shell
litellm proxy --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

After running the proxy you can access it on `http://0.0.0.0:4000/api/v1/` (since we set `SERVER_ROOT_PATH="/api/v1"`)

### 3. Verify Running on correct path


**That's it**, that's all you need to run the proxy on a custom root path
